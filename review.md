The package describes what was asked in the prior module and also was published.

The package is easy to follow and well organized. 
I do understand the logic behind the package and capable of undestanding its function
I could use this package and work with it. Has some very nice functions and it could
be posible to build on it.

i totally liked how well organized and easy to follow the package is to read.
